# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project is an analysis of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) on an epidemiological and molecular level, using data from PHC4 and GSE127967.

All csv files are data on overdose, maternal opioid use disorder, and neonatal abstinence syndrome from PHC4, found on opendataPA. These are all loaded in, cleaned, and used to visualize the NAS epidemic in Pennsylvania. 

Microarray data was obtained from GEO GSE127967, origingally from the paper "Modeling Parkinsonâ€™s disease in midbrain-like organoids." These files are read in and explored, with further analysis needed in the future in order to use this data for future comparison of NAS organoid data.
