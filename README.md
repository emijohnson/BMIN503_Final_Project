# BMIN503/EPID600 Final Project

This project is an analysis of NAS on an epidemiological and molecular level, using data from PHC4 and GSE76381. 

All csv files are data on overdose, maternal opioid use disorder, and neonatal abstinence syndrome from PHC4, found on opendataPA. These are all loaded in, cleaned, and used to visualize the NAS epidemic in Pennsylvania. 

The txt files are all counts from GSE76381, origingally from the paper Molecular Diversity of Midbrain Development in
Mouse, Human, and Stem Cells. These files are read in and the Seurat single cell analysis package is used to analyze and visualize the molecular markers of midbrain development.
